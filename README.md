# SpringTest1
Our study project on Spring.
We have 2 databases:
  • Oracle - our university db.
  • MySQL - our own db, with similar tables for schedule.
Purposes:
  1. Update data in MySQL db by checking Oracle db and notify users about changes in schedule with websockets.
  2. Return data by http reqests, like info about lecturer or group schedule for defined date.
